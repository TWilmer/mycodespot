Write a function that swaps MSB with LSB

{{{
#include <stdio.h>

//unsigned int swap(int in);

main (){
unsigned int in = 0x0902ef93;

printf("in =: %x \n", in);
printf("out =: %x \n", swap(in));

return 0;
}

int swap(unsigned int in){
unsigned int out=0;
int i;

for(i=0;i<32;i++){
out = out << 1;
out |= (in & 1);
in = in >> 1;
}
return out;
}
